# Execution Team Project Filtering Implementation

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!**

The Execution Team role now has **restricted project visibility** - they cannot see projects with statuses PV75, PV90, UB, and WB.

---

## 🔐 **Project Status Filtering by Role**

### **Execution Team Hidden Statuses:**
- ❌ **PV75** - Not visible
- ❌ **PV90** - Not visible  
- ❌ **UB** - Not visible
- ❌ **WB** - Not visible

### **Execution Team Visible Statuses:**
- ✅ **WIP** - Visible (Work In Progress)
- ✅ **QF** - Visible (Quality Form)
- ✅ **Completed** - Visible

---

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Project Filter Service** (`src/services/projectFilterService.ts`)
- **`isProjectStatusVisibleToUser()`** - Checks if status is visible to user type
- **`filterProjectsByUserRole()`** - Filters projects based on user role
- **`getAvailableProjectStatuses()`** - Returns available statuses for user type
- **`getHiddenProjectStatuses()`** - Returns hidden statuses for user type

### **2. Updated ProjectListPage** (`src/features/project/pages/ProjectListPage.tsx`)
- **Role-based filtering** applied before other filters
- **Status filter tabs** only show available statuses for current user
- **Real-time filtering** based on authenticated user's role

- Execution Team only sees relevant status options
- Prevents confusion and unauthorized access

### **Seamless Integration:**
- Works with existing search and sort functionality
- Maintains all other filtering capabilities

## 🔒 **Security Benefits**

1. **Data Privacy**: Execution Team cannot see early-stage projects
2. **Role Separation**: Clear distinction between planning and execution phases
3. **Access Control**: Automatic enforcement of visibility rules
4. **User Experience**: Clean interface showing only relevant projects

---

## ✅ **Ready to Test!**

The Execution Team role now has **restricted project visibility** as requested. When logged in as Execution Team:

- **Hidden Projects**: PV75, PV90, UB, WB status projects are completely hidden
- **Visible Projects**: Only WIP, QF, and Completed projects are shown
- **Filter Options**: Status filter tabs only show available statuses
- **Seamless Experience**: No broken links or error messages

The system now properly enforces role-based project visibility! 🚀
