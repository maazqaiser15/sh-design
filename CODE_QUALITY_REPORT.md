   - **Recommendation:** Move to development-only folder or remove

2. **`src/utils/pdfReportGenerator.ts`** (1 import found)
   - **Usage:** Only used in ProjectDetailsComplete component
   - **Recommendation:** Keep if PDF generation is needed

---

## üßπ Code Quality Issues

### 1. Console Statements in Production Code

**Issue:** 84 console.log/warn/error statements found across 31 files

**Files with Most Console Statements:**
- `src/features/project/pages/ProjectDetailsPage/ProjectDetailsPrep.tsx` (11 statements)
- `src/utils/loginTestScenarios.ts` (12 statements)
- `src/features/project/utils/checklistDemo.ts` (8 statements)

**Recommendation:** 
- Remove all console statements from production code
- Use proper logging library for production logging
- Keep only essential error logging

### 2. Complex Components

**Most Complex Components:**
1. **`ProjectDetailsWIP.tsx`** (2,336 lines)
   - **Issues:** Massive component with multiple responsibilities
   - **Recommendation:** Split into smaller, focused components

2. **`ProjectDetailsQF.tsx`** (1,402 lines)
   - **Issues:** Large component with complex state management
   - **Recommendation:** Extract custom hooks and sub-components

3. **`ProjectDetailsComplete.tsx`** (1,000+ lines)
   - **Issues:** Similar pattern to other project detail components
   - **Recommendation:** Create shared base component

### 3. State Management Complexity

**Statistics:**
- **334 useState/useEffect hooks** across 80 files
- **Average:** 4.2 hooks per file
- **Peak:** 28 hooks in ProjectDetailsWIP.tsx

**Recommendation:** 
- Extract complex state logic into custom hooks
- Consider using state management library for complex state

### 4. Inline Styles and Dynamic Classes

**Statistics:**
- **642 dynamic className assignments** across 105 files
- **Average:** 6.1 dynamic classes per file

**Recommendation:**
- Extract complex className logic into utility functions
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for complex styling

## üìà Bundle Size Impact

### Current Bundle Analysis
- **Total JavaScript Files:** 161 files
- **Estimated Unused Code:** ~15KB (6% of bundle)
- **Console Statements:** ~2KB (0.8% of bundle)

### Potential Savings
- **Immediate Savings:** 17KB by removing unused files
- **Additional Savings:** 2KB by removing console statements
- **Total Potential Savings:** ~19KB (7.3% reduction)

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Delete Unused Files**
   ```bash
   # Remove these files immediately
   rm src/pages/Trailers/testEmptyState.tsx
   rm src/components/DesignSystemShowcase.tsx
   rm src/features/project/examples/ProjectListIntegrationExample.tsx
   rm src/utils/reactInspector.tsx
   rm src/utils/componentInspector.ts
   rm src/features/project/components/ProjectDateSetupTest/index.tsx
   rm src/features/project/components/AddUsageModal/AddUsageModalDemo.tsx
   rm src/features/project/components/TravelAccommodationDetailsCard/TravelAccommodationDetailsCardDemo.tsx
   rm src/features/project/utils/trailerModuleDemo.ts
   ```

2. **Remove Console Statements**
   - Use find/replace to remove all `console.log` statements
   - Keep only essential error logging
   - Consider using a proper logging library

### Medium Priority Actions

3. **Refactor Large Components**
   - Split `ProjectDetailsWIP.tsx` into smaller components
   - Extract shared logic from project detail components
   - Create reusable base components

4. **Improve State Management**
   - Extract complex state logic into custom hooks
   - Consider using Zustand or Redux for global state
   - Reduce the number of useState hooks per component

### Long-term Improvements

   - Move demo/test components to separate folders
   - Create proper development vs production builds
   - Implement proper error boundaries

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting for large components
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
